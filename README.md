# Unit Testing in Java: A Slidev Presentation

This repository contains a slide deck created using the Slidev presentation tool. The presentation serves as a template for my future presentations as an intern at ChatChatABC, Davao City, Philippines. Each slide showcases different features based on Slidev's official documentation, such as insertion of interactive code snippets, code line highlighting, embedding social media posts, and many more.



## Getting Started

To view the presentation, simply clone this repository and open the slides.md file in any integrated development environment (IDE). Open a new terminal and type the command:

```
npm run dev
```

The slide deck should show up on a new tab at your default browser.
